# CSS Grid Talk

Oh please do not look at the source for this talk's website. It's awful and not something I want to be remembered or judged by. Please understand I was in a hurry. I know it's no excuse and I should have my CSS license revoked but but but but sometimes ya gotta do what ya gotta do.

Hopefully I'll attach the recording to this repo when it's done.

Thanks,
James
